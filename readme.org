  A small experiment to play with pixelwise centering of org-headings in a
  buffer. OBS: this is just an experiment, the purpose is not to propose a final
  product, but just to illustrate an idea.

  It means there are probably lots of places where it will break. I have put it
  together just as a small demo, to showcase it is possible to do text
  alignement in Emacs. With other words, this is not an application to use on
  every day basis.

  There is a small video showing how it works in practice:

* <>Installation  

  Either clone this repo or just download 'org-cebter-headings.el'.

  Put org-center-headings.el somewhere in Emacs load-path. From there you
  have option to either:

  M-x package-install-file RET org-center-headings.el RET

  or just require file in your init file somewhere.
  
* Requirements

  Really none, should be compatible with Emacs 22.1 but package.el does not
  recognize requirements older than Emacs 24.1.

* Usage

  Place cursor on a line with org-heading and type

  M-x org-center-headings-center

  to center a heading, or

  M-x org-center-headings-remove-centering

  to remove the center alignement.

  This introduces also experimental formatting string for headings: '<>'
  (without quotes). It should be placed after space that follows leading stars
  in a heading. The string is used together with a minor mode
  org-center-headings-mode to control wich headings will be
  centered. Alternatively it is possible to bypass the format string and center
  all headings in a buffer by setting value of:

  org-center-headings-formatted-only

  to nil.

  As a small plus, there is also a minor mode to hide the format string used to
  center headings.
